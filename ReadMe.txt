Data sourced from: https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/hr-analytics



Kaggle challenge:(not relevant for the stream 2 project at Code Institute but nice to have some ideas about possible insights)
Why are our best and most experienced employees leaving prematurely? Have fun with this database and try to predict which valuable employees will leave next. Fields in the dataset include:

Last evaluation
Number of projects
Average monthly hours
Time spent at the company
Whether they have had a work accident
Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years
Department
Salary
Whether the employee has left
